				<h1>Our Programming, Web Design and Data Science Training Courses</h1>
				<p>
					There are many ICT training institutes around but it is not every one of them that their students are happy with. They are usually little teaching and interactions time between their students and instructors; some of these training schools over populate their training sessions with students.<br/><br/>
					Needless to say some of their students are left frustrated, discouraged and inadequately trained.<br/><br/>
					Our practical, one-one-one and schedule flexible training model distinguish us from other ICT schools.
					You will be taught alone at your convinience, the one-one-one training session will also give you the opportunity to pause the session and ask question at any time for immediate clarification.<br/><br/>
					To reinforce what you will be learning and to build your confidence, during your study period, you will be working on a real life project of your choice under close supervission of your private instructor.<br/><br/>
					Below are short overview of our courses:<br/><br/>

					<h1>Data Science Course Overview</h1>
					<h3>Certification: Applied Certificate in Data Science with Python</h3>
					<h3>Duration: Self-paced (56 hrs)</h3>
					<h3>Location: Abuja</h3>
					<h3>Cost: N120,000</h3>
				</p>

					In this Data science course, you will learn from the basics of conducting data science project, how to perform data analysis in python, how to apply the technicalities and knowledge acquired to solving real life problems and facilitating informed decision making.<br/><br/>
					This course will introduce you to the field of data science and will prepare you for other specialized data science areas like Machine Learning (ML), Apache Spark, Hadoop, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
					First, and foremost, you'll learn how to do data science by learning how to analyze data.<br/><br/>
					This include knowing how to import data, explore it, analyze it, learn from it, visualize it, and ultimately generate easily shareable reports.
					To really do data analysis with python, we will teach you a collection of powerful, open-source, tools including: Python, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and you won't be learning these tools in isolation in this course.<br/> You will be learning these tools all within the context of compelling real life data sets.<br/><br/>

					Specific learning Objectives of the course include developing the basic process of doing data science, mastering how to use Jupyter notebooks (the main environment for doing data science), applied understanding manipulating NumPy arrays, data cleaning and preparation, being comfortable with visualizing data and results.<br/>
					You will also learn how to use functions to process NumPy data in manners which are time and space efficient than Python data object.
				</p>
				<div class="courseList">					
				<p>
					We will specifically be covering broad and imperative topics such as but not limited to:
					<ul>
						<li>Understanding data types in Python versus NumPy</li>
						<li>NumPy array attributes</li>
						<li>Indexing in NumPy</li>
						<li>Broadcasting in NumPy</li>
						<li>Sorting arrays in NumPy</li>
						<li>Pandas objects</li>
						<li>Handling missing data in Pandas</li>
						<li>Combining datasets in Pandas</li>
						<li>Aggregation in Pandas</li>
						<li>Vectorized string operations</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</div>
					
				<p>
					When working with large datasets, you often need to visualize your data to gain a better understanding of it. Also, when you reach conclusions about the data, you'll often wish to use visualizations to present your results. This is why Matplotlib is a cannot-do-without Python for data science library.<br/><br/><div  class="viewSyllabus"><a href="data-science-Course-Syllabus.html">View complete syllabus</a></div>

				</p>
					
				<p>
					With everything we would have learnt from the previous sections, we will take an in-depth tour into Matplotlib tool for data visualization in Python and we will be exploring such topics as:
				</p>
				<div class="courseList">
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Setting plot styles in Matplotlib</li>
						<li>Saving figures to file</li>
						<li>Adjusting the plot features</li>
						<li>Visualizing a three-dimensional function</li>
						<li>Customizing plot legends</li>
						<li>Multiple subplots</li>
						<li>Text and annotation</li>
						<li>Three-dimensional plotting in Matplotlib</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</div>

				<div>					
				<p>
					Introduction to Machine Learning section of the course will be covering and introducing such advance data science tools and topics like
					<ul>
						<li>Scikit-Learn</li>
						<li>Introduction to Seaborn</li>
						<li>Exploring Seaborn plots</li>
						<li>Introduction to machine learning</li>
						<li>Machine Learning Algorithms</li>
						<li>K means Clustering</li>
						<li>Logistic Regression</li>
						<li>Decision Tree</li>
						<li>Random Forest</li>
						<li>Apriori Algorithm</li>
						<li>… and many more.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					By the end of this course, you will be able to find a dataset, formulate a research question, use the tools and techniques learned to ask, explore and answer insightful questions from the data, share and present your findings in professionally comprehensive way, using data visualization where applicable.<br/><br/>
