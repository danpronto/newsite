						Data science is a term that covers many scopes, from careers to work practices, it touch every facets of modern life.<br/>
						Recording data is as old as counting, but what is new is the way data science use special tools and techniques to analyze data for meaningful insights that greatly benefit users.<br/><br/>
						Python has in recent years become and remained the default language with first-class tool of libraries used for scientific computing tasks such as data analysis, data visualization and Machine Learning (ML) of large datasets, of which common and conventional non-programming data analysis packages like excel, STATA, SPSS, MATLAB etc will not dream of handling<br/><br/>
						The advantages of using Python tools for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party complimenting packages like:<br/>
					<div class="unstyleList">
					<ul>
						<li>NumPy and Pandas for manipulating homogeneous array data and heterogenous labeled data respectively</li>
						<li>Anaconda full stack package used by professional data scientists</li>
						<li>SciPy for scientific computing tasks</li>
						<li>Matplotlib for publication of quality data visualizations</li>

						Does your business or company have a well maintained functioning website?<br/>
						Your website is a powerful marketing tool.  I feel like this should not be strange statement to you  even as you must have observed how your competitors are getting ahead of you in your industry if you have no functioning and well maintained business website in this modern business environment.<br/><br/>
						If your business is among the about 50% of the world’s small businesses without a website, then it is important to have one because of the many benefits it offers for your business expanssion and success.<br/>
						For example, by placing your web address on your physically distributed products, it serves as an effective means of advertisement and making your company‘s brand present and accessible to your customers and millions of potential new customers on the web.<br/><br/>
						Having a website improves your business productivity because less time is spent explaining your products' or services' qualities to customers, and again, this information can be delivered any hour in a well thought out  form on your website.<br/>
						Owning a business website will give you and your customers more cheaper and easier two-way communication channel to contact you, give you feedback on your products/services or ask about product availability, thus improving your customer service and building a better company image.<br/><br/>
						Contact us today for your website solution, we can help you build a professional website to help you expand your market reach to the world or revamp your existing website and get it professionally maintained to starting getting the best results.<br/>
